## Introduction

Each directory contains python projects and code that I wrote during my week 1 at Skaehub. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind python, datatypes, and basic data structures. There is info and trivia questions that we go over in each directory.

## Description of Each Directory.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```Day1``` | Interfacing with Functions in python. |
| ```Day2``` | Python data types. |
| ```Day3``` | Python more confident, interfacing with python numpy library. |
| ```Day4``` | More libraries, Interfacing with Nominatim API and GeoPy package and also lambda. |
| ```Day5``` | Version control with git and github. |
| ```Day6``` | Test Driven Development with unittest, pytest and nose. |
| ```Day7``` | More Test Criven Development with unittest, pytest and nose. |
