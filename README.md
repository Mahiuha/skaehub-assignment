## Introduction

Each directory contains python projects and code that I wrote during my week 1 at Skaehub. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind python, datatypes, and basic data structures. There is info and trivia questions that we go over in each directory.

## Description of Each Directory.

| Directory | Description |

| Day1 | Interfacing with SQLite database, we wrote a Python program to create an SQLite database and connect with the database and print the version of the SQLite database. |
